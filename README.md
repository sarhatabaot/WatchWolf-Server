# WatchWolf - Server [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/miranda1000/watchwolf-server/badge/dev)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/miranda1000/watchwolf-server/overview/dev)

The in-game half of [WatchWolf](https://watchwolf.dev/): a **Spigot plugin** that opens a socket
and executes the Tester's petitions against the live server — place and read blocks, spawn and
inspect entities, teleport players, give items, run commands, manage WorldGuard regions, record
video and collect timings reports.

`dev.watchwolf:watchwolf-server` · **Java 8** · Spigot 1.8 → latest

You can download a pre-compiled version [here](https://watchwolf.dev/versions/).

## How it runs

You do not normally install this by hand.
[WatchWolf-ServersManager](https://github.com/miranda1000/WatchWolf-ServersManager) keeps a
copy in its `usual-plugins/` folder and drops it into every server it starts, together with a
generated config:

```yaml
# plugins/WatchWolf/config.yml
target-ip: 127.0.0.1   # the only IP allowed to talk to the socket
use-port: 25566        # published by the container as <minecraftPort>+1
```

On `onEnable` the plugin starts a socket thread on `use-port`, hooks a log4j appender onto the
console (so command output and stack traces can be forwarded), and registers a 1-tick repeating
Bukkit task. Every petition that touches the Bukkit API is queued onto that task, because the
socket thread is not the server's main thread.

## Features

| Area | Operations |
| --- | --- |
| World | set/get block, spawn entity, get entities, change difficulty |
| Players | whitelist, OP, teleport, give item, read position/pitch/yaw/inventory, list players |
| Console | run command and capture its reply, forward captured exceptions |
| Safety | invincible mode (cancel all player damage) |
| WorldGuard | create region, list regions, list regions at a position |
| Enhanced info | place/move/stop camera (video), start/stop timings report |

Optional integrations degrade gracefully: WorldGuard is picked by version (API 6 below `7.0.0`,
API 7 above) and falls back to a no-op implementation when the plugin is absent; timings switch
between Spigot and Paper implementations at runtime.

## Compile

Use a JDK supported by Gradle 9 (Java 17 or newer). The compiled plugin targets **Java 8**.

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat assemble`. The shaded artifact is
named `WatchWolf-<version>-1.8-LATEST.jar` — that `-<minMc>-<maxMc>` suffix is the naming
convention the ServersManager's `usual-plugins/` folder expects, so the jar can be copied straight
across.

### Dependencies

Gradle resolves `spigot-api:1.16.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT` from the Spigot snapshots repository. It is a
compile-only dependency: Minecraft supplies the API at runtime. This plugin does not import NMS or
CraftBukkit classes, so building it needs no local Spigot server JAR. Gradle resolves
`WatchWolf-Core:0.3.3` and `XSeries:9.9.0` from JitPack and shades them into the plugin JAR.
ServersManager now defaults to the itzg runtime, which downloads the requested supported Paper
version when an instance starts. Prebuilt server JARs under `server-types/` are needed only when
the explicit `legacy` fallback is selected.

XSeries keeps the plugin working
across every Minecraft version despite compiling against the 1.16.5 API.

### Publish to GitHub Packages

Set `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (with package publish access), then run:

```bash
./ci/publish.sh
```

This publishes the shaded JAR to `https://maven.pkg.github.com/miranda1000/watchwolf-server`.

## Testing

There are no tests in this repository. The plugin is exercised end to end by
[WatchWolf-Tester](https://github.com/miranda1000/WatchWolf-Tester)'s own suite, which starts
real servers running this jar.

## Adding support for a new block property

Block properties are code-generated. The procedure spans several repositories and is documented in
[WatchWolf-MaterialGetter](https://github.com/miranda1000/WatchWolf-MaterialGetter); on this
side it ends in `SpigotToWatchWolfTranslator#getBlock()` and
`WatchWolfToSpigotTranslator#getBlockData()`. Because the wire layout changes, it is also a
protocol change — update `API/API.tex` and `API/A-Blocks.tex` in the
[WatchWolf](https://github.com/watch-wolf/WatchWolf) repository.
